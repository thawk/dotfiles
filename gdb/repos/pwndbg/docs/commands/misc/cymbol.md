### Notes
The `cymbol` command loads custom C structs and symbols into the debugger using GCC under the hood.

 Usage Example:
    `cymbol file --force ./structs.h`

 --force:
    Use this flag to force symbol reloading, even if symbols with the same name already exist.

 Warning:
    If a loaded structure defines a symbol that already exists, the debugger may prefer the original
    symbol or behave unexpectedly. Itâ€™s recommended to use unique struct names to avoid
    symbol conflicts.


 Tip:
    You can add this command to your `.gdbinit` file for automatic loading:
        `cymbol file --force ./path/to/structs.h`
