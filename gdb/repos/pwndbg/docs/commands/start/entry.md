# entry

```text
usage: entry [-h] [args ...]

```

Start the debugged program stopping at its entrypoint address.

Note that the entrypoint may not be the first instruction executed
by the program. If you want to stop on the first executed instruction,
use the GDB's `starti` command or LLDB's `process launch -s`.

Args may include "*", or "[...]"; they are expanded using the
shell that will start the program (specified by the "$SHELL" environment
variable).  Input and output redirection with ">", "<", or ">>"
are also allowed.

With no arguments, uses arguments last specified (with "run" or
"set args").  To cancel previous arguments and run with no arguments,
use "set args" without arguments.

To start the inferior without using a shell, use "set startup-with-shell off".
