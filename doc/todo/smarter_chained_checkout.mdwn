When there are chained mrconfig files, mr could be smarter about
checkouts and updates. Ie, when a new version of an mrconfig file is
checked out or updated, throw all the info from the old one away, and
process the new one.

Until this is fixed, checkouts and updates need to be manually repeated
after mrconfig files have changes. (See #447553)
