I have just used this hack to workaround this issue:

    find -maxdepth 1 -type d -a -\( -execdir grep -q {} ~/.mrconfig \; -o -okdir mr register '{}' \; -\)

What it does is look in the current directory, one level deep, for directories and check if they are in `~/.mrconfig`. If they aren't, ask if they should be registered. Obviously, this should check for stuff like if `.git` exists and so on, but considering the variety of repos supported by mr, i figured I would keep this simple. --[[anarcat]]
