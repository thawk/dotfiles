Hi,

I too experienced this issue with `order` an `jobs`, but in my case I wanted
to process one specific repository (the vcsh one with `order=1`) **before**
all the others.

The specific case I wanted to cover is when the main vcsh repository has some
updated hooks, so I want it to be updated before updating or cloning all the
other repositories managed by vcsh.

The idea of having some value of `order` mean \"*first*\" or \"*last*\", and
serialize the repositories which use them outside of the multi-processing
dispatch is tempting.

Ciao,
   Antonio
