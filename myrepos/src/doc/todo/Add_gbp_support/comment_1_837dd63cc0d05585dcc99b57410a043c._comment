Please add a link to a git repository containing the commit you want to add.

Some suggestions for that:

Please include the gbp support as a plugin rather than in mr itself.

Please add a copyright and license notice in comments at the start of the plugin.

Please add some documentation in comments at the start of the plugin.

Please use perl: for the gbp_test/git_test code, it is faster and most of the other *_test code uses it.

Please sync gbp_grep with git_grep, the latter always returns true.
