I don't think I understand the value of this plugin.  The only gbp command that I can imagine wanting to run in batch across all my repos is `gbp clone`, so I could see the value of a short plugin that handles cloning and registering gbp repos.  But I don't see why you would ever want to run `gbp dch` across more than one repo at once.
