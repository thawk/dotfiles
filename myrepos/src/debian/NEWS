mr (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  In this version, mr has changed to not trust all mrconfig files by
  default. Untrusted files are only allowed to run carefully checked commands.
  Only the main ~/.mrconfig is now trusted by default. If you have other
  mrconfig files, containing unusual commands, that mr should trust, you
  will need to list them in ~/.mrtrust.

  Also in this version, the -p flag is on by default, so mr will
  look for a .mrconfig file in the current directory or one of its parent
  directories, in addition to the main ~/.mrconfig file.
